# flatManagement
Console app for managing multiple apartment buildings

This project was created in 2023 and contains all /src files in the exact form they were coded during that time.
It also won't be changes in the future. I decided to keep this repo unchanges to beter show my code progression.

The project was done as part of a GUI (Graphical User Interface) Java Course during my University studies.
I recieved the highest mark possible for this project together with distinctions.
Apart from all necessary functionality, I coded additional tools for querying local files which has earned me the ealier mentioned distintions.

Functionality:
- managing complexes of apartment buildings (each complex can have multiple apartment buildings, each building multiple flats)
- managing tenants
- managing leases (both of flats and parking spaces)
- managing storage and parking spaces
- time simulation using multithreading
- automatic event handling
- writing / reading current status from files

Main focus was put on:
- inheritance
- collections
- interfaces
- abstract classes
- lambda expressions
- generic types
- custom data structures
- multithreading

If I were to revisit this project again I would:
- definitelly work on better code clarity. I would add extensive comments and group certain classes further.
